Quick guide to Buckshot Roulette, command line edition.

Buckshot roulette is a complex twist on the simple 'game' of Russian Roulette. In it, you're pitted against a cold being√¢ the dealer. A shotgun is placed in front of you; loaded with some lives, some blanks. It's up to you to kill the dealer. 
You go first. You have the option to A. Shoot the dealer or B. Shoot yourself. If you hit yourself with a blank, you get another turn. Simple. 
To help you out, you get some items. The dealer gets them, too.

    Handcuffs:	Causes the dealer to skip their next turn
    Hand Saw:	Doubles the damage of your shotgun
    Beer:	Ejects the shell that's in the chamber
    Cigarettes:	heals one life point
    Magnifying Glass:	Allows you to examine the shell currently in the chamber
    


    The below part is beta... hope to have it done soon!    
    If you take the pills, you'll begin a game of double or nothing, which will introduce a new set of items.
    Double Or Nothing items:
    Inverter:	Reverses the effect of the shell currently in the chamber. A blank will turn into a live round and a live round turns into a blank.
    Adrenaline:	The player will steal an item from the dealer's board and use it immediately
    Burner phone:	Will inform you about a random round in your stack
    Expired medicine:	50% chance of regaining two lives, 50% chance of losing one life
    
Your shaky hands are in control of the gun. Will you make it out alive? 

Bonus Features:
run with the --perfect flag and the dealer will always know the current shell and play accordingly
run with the --double flag to try out the (not finished) double or nothing beta with some of the items!
