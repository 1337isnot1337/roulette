All (I think) code made by 1337isnot1337 (or whatever my current github name is). 
The art for the live and blank shells was made by MikMaryt and taken from the python 
project https://github.com/MikMaryt/Buckshot-Roulette.
This code is protected by the GPL 3.0 License. It is open source of course; all code visible on my GitHub. 
If you have any problems with the code, or questions, fill out an issue on the GitHub. 
If you wish to contribute, send a pull request. Thank you. :3
